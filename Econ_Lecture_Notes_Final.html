<h2 id="module1" style="border-bottom: 2px solid #bbb; margin-top: 40px; font-size: 30px;">Module 1: Limits, Alternatives, and Choices</h2>
<h2 id="module1-lo">Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Define economics and the features of the economic perspective.</li>
<li>Describe the role of economic theory in economics.</li>
<li>Distinguish microeconomics from macroeconomics and positive economics from normative economics.</li>
<li>Explain the individual‚Äôs economizing problem and how trade-offs, opportunity costs, and attainable combination can be illustrated with budget lines.</li>
<li>List the categories of scarce resources and delineate the nature of society‚Äôs economizing problem.</li>
<li>Apply production possibilities analysis, increasing opportunity costs, and economic growth.</li>
<li>Explain how economic growth and international trade increase consumption possibilities.</li>
<li>Understand graphs, curves, and slopes as they relate to economics.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="module1-definition">Definition of Economics</h2>
<p>Economics is the social science concerned with how individuals, institutions, and society make optimal choices under conditions of scarcity.</p>
<p>Human wants are unlimited, but the means to satisfy the wants are limited.</p>
<h2 id="module1-perspective">The Economic Perspective</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="highlight">Scarcity and choice:</span> Resources can only be used for one purpose at a time. Scarcity requires that choices be made. The cost of any good, service, or activity is the value of what must be given up to obtain it. This is known as the opportunity cost.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consider This ‚Ä¶ Free for All?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Products provided for ‚Äúfree‚Äù to an individual are not free for society because scarce resources are still used to produce them.</li>
<li>Companies often offer ‚Äúfree‚Äù products as a marketing strategy.</li>
<li>‚ÄúFree‚Äù items may be bundled with paid goods‚Äîthus, not really free to the buyer.</li>
<li>This leads to the classic economic phrase: <span class="highlight">‚ÄúThere is no free lunch.‚Äù</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Purposeful Behavior</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rational self-interest means making decisions that maximize utility (satisfaction).</li>
<li>Utility is measured in <i>utils</i>.</li>
<li>People have different preferences, constraints, and information‚Äîso choices vary.</li>
<li>Rational self-interest ‚â† selfishness.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Marginal Analysis: Comparing Benefits and Costs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Economic decisions often involve marginal changes (small adjustments to current behavior).</li>
<li>Weigh marginal benefit (MB) against marginal cost (MC).</li>
<li>Choose when MB ‚â• MC.</li>
<li><span class="highlight">Opportunity cost:</span> The value of the next best alternative that is forgone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consider This ‚Ä¶ Fast Food Lines‚ÄîAn Economic Perspective</h3>
<ul>
<li>People pick the shortest line to reduce time costs‚Äîrational decision-making.</li>
<li>As people shift between lines, line lengths tend to equalize.</li>
<li>Imperfect info may cause longer waits or missed opportunities.</li>
<li>Even once at the counter, decisions (what to order) involve weighing costs and benefits.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="module1-theories">Theories, Principles, and Models</h2>
<p>Economists use the scientific method to establish theories, laws, and principles.</p>
<p>The scientific method consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The observation of facts (real data).</li>
<li>The formulations of explanations of cause and effect relationships (hypotheses) based upon the facts.</li>
<li>The testing of the hypotheses.</li>
<li>The acceptance, rejection, or modification of the hypotheses.</li>
<li>The continued testing with an eye toward determination of a theory, law, principle, or model.</li>
</ul>
<p>Theories, principles, and models are ‚Äúpurposeful simplifications.‚Äù</p>
<p>Principles are used to explain and/or predict the behavior of individuals and institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Terminology</strong>‚ÄîPrinciples, laws, theories, and models are all terms that refer to generalizations about economic behavior. They are used synonymously in the text, with custom or convenience governing the choice in each particular case.</p>
<p><strong>Generalizations</strong>‚ÄîEconomic principles are expressed as the tendencies of the typical or average consumer, worker, or business firm.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúOther things equal‚Äù or ceteris paribus assumption</strong>‚ÄîIn order to judge the effect one variable has upon another it is necessary to hold other contributing factors constant. Natural scientists can test with much greater precision than can economists. They have the advantage of controlled laboratory experiment. Economists must test their theories using the real world as their laboratory.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Expression</strong>‚ÄîMany economic relationships are quantitative, and are demonstrated efficiently with graphs. The ‚Äúkey graphs‚Äù are the most important.</p>
<h2 id="module1-micro-macro">Microeconomics and Macroeconomics</h2>
<p>Microeconomics looks at specific economic units.</p>
<p>It is concerned with the individual industry, firm or household and the price of specific products and resources.</p>
<p>It is an examination of sand, rocks, and shells, and not the beach.</p>
<p>Macroeconomics examines the economy as a whole.</p>
<p>It includes measures of total output, total employment, total income, aggregate expenditures, and the general price level.</p>
<p>It is a general overview examining the beach, not the sand, rocks, and shells.</p>
<h2 id="module1-positive-normative">Positive and Normative Economics</h2>
<p>Positive economics describes the economy as it actually is, avoiding value judgments and attempting to establish scientific statements about economic behavior.</p>
<p>Normative economics involves value judgments about what the economy should be like and the desirability of the policy options available.</p>
<p>Most disagreements among economists involve normative, value-based questions.</p>
<h2 id="module1-economizing">Individual‚Äôs Economizing Problem</h2>
<p>Individuals are confronted with the need to make choices because their wants exceed their means to satisfy them.</p>
<p><strong>Limited income</strong> ‚Äì everyone, even the most wealthy, has a finite amount of money to spend.</p>
<p><strong>Unlimited wants</strong> ‚Äì people‚Äôs wants are virtually unlimited.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wants include both necessities and luxuries (although many economists don‚Äôt worry about this distinction).</li>
<li>Wants change, especially as new products are introduced.</li>
<li>Both goods and services satisfy wants.</li>
<li>Even the wealthiest have wants that extend beyond their means (e.g. Bill Gates‚Äô charitable efforts).</li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of limited income and unlimited wants force us to choose those goods and services that will maximize our utility.</p>
<h2 id="module1-budget-line">Budget Line</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A schedule or curve that shows the various combinations of two products a consumer can purchase with a specific money income.</p>
<p>The model assumes two goods, but the analysis generalizes to all goods available to consumers.</p>
<p>The location of a budget line depends on a consumer‚Äôs money income, and the prices of the two products under analysis.</p>
<p>The slope of the graphed budget line is the ratio of the price of the good measured on the horizontal axis (Pb in the text) to the price of the good measured on the vertical axis (Pdvd). A change in the price of one of the goods will change the slope of the budget line and change the purchasing power of the consumer.</p>
<p>The budget line illustrates a number of important ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Points on or inside the budget line represent points that are attainable given the relevant income and prices. Points outside (up and to the right) the budget line are unattainable.</li>
<li>Tradeoffs and opportunity costs ‚Äì the negative slope of the budget line represents that consumers must make tradeoffs in their consumption decisions; the value of the slope measures precisely the opportunity cost of one more unit of a good under analysis.</li>
<li>Limited income and positive prices force people to choose. Note that the budget line does not indicate what a consumer will choose, only what they can.</li>
<li>Income changes will shift the budget line. Greater income will shift the line out and to the right, allowing consumers to purchase more of both goods. Increasing income lessens scarcity, but does not eliminate it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consider This ‚Ä¶ Did Zuckerberg, Seacrest, and Swift Make Bad Choices?</h3>
<p>The college decision requires weighing future benefits, including projected lifetime earnings, against present costs, including direct costs (tuition) and indirect costs (forgone wages).</p>
<p>Despite the success of celebrities such as Mark Zuckerberg, Ryan Seacrest, and Taylor Swift, in general those attending and completing college will earn greater lifetime earnings (about 50% more) than those holding only high school diplomas.</p>
<p>For Zuckerberg, Seacrest, Swift, and others like them, the opportunity cost of college was extremely high, and it would be hard to argue that they made a wrong decision.</p>
<h2 id="module1-society">Society‚Äôs Economizing Problem</h2>
<h3>Scarce resources</h3>
<p>Economic resources are limited relative to wants.</p>
<p>Economic resources are sometimes called factors of production and include all natural, human, and manufactured resources used to produce goods and services.</p>
<h3>Resource categories:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Land</strong> or natural resources (‚Äúgifts of nature‚Äù).</li>
<li><strong>Labor</strong> or human resources, which include physical and mental abilities used in production.</li>
<li><strong>Capital</strong> or investment goods, which are all manufactured aids to production like tools, equipment, factories, transportation, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Entrepreneurial ability</strong>, a special kind of human resource that provides four important functions:
        <ul>
<li>Combines resources needed for production.</li>
<li>Makes basic business policy decisions.</li>
<li>Is an innovator for new products, production techniques, and organizational forms.</li>
<li>Bears the risk of time, effort, and funds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="module1-ppc">Production Possibilities Curve (PPC)</h2>
<p>Production possibilities tables and curves are devices used to illustrate and clarify society‚Äôs economizing problem.</p>
<h3>Assumptions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Economy is employing all available resources (Full employment).</li>
<li>Available supply of resources is fixed in quantity and quality at this point in time.</li>
<li>Technology is constant during analysis.</li>
<li>Economy produces only two types of products.</li>
</ul>
<p>While any two goods or services could be used, the example in the chapter assumes that one product is a consumer good (pizza), the other a capital good (industrial robots).</p>
<p>Consumer goods directly satisfy wants; capital goods, which are used to produce consumer goods, indirectly satisfy wants.</p>
<p>Choices will be necessary because resources and technology are fixed. A production possibilities table illustrates some of the possible choices (see Table 1.1).</p>
<p>A production possibilities curve is a graphical representation of choices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Points on the curve represent maximum possible combinations of robots and pizza given resources and technology.</li>
<li>Points inside the curve represent underemployment or unemployment.</li>
<li>Points outside the curve are unattainable at present.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Optimal or best product-mix:</h3>
<ul>
<li>It will be some point on the curve.</li>
<li>The exact point depends on society; this is a normative decision.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Law of increasing opportunity costs:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The amount of other products that must be foregone to obtain more of any given product is called the opportunity cost.</li>
<li>Opportunity costs are measured in real terms rather than money (market prices are not part of the production possibilities model).</li>
<li>The more of a product produced the greater is its (marginal) opportunity cost.</li>
<li>The slope of the production possibilities curve becomes steeper, demonstrating increasing opportunity cost. This makes the curve appear bowed out, concave from the origin.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Economic Rationale:</h3>
<p>Economic resources are not completely adaptable to alternative uses.</p>
<p>To get increasing amounts of pizza, resources not particularly well suited for the purpose of making pizza must be used. For example, workers that are accustomed to producing robots on an assembly line may not do well as kitchen help.</p>
<h3>Optimal allocation revisited:</h3>
<p>How does society decide its optimal point on the production possibilities curve?</p>
<ul>
<li>Recall that society receives marginal benefits from each additional product consumed, and as long as this marginal benefit is more than the additional cost of the product, it is advantageous to have the additional product.</li>
<li>Conversely, if the additional (marginal) cost of obtaining an additional product is more than the additional benefit received, then it is not ‚Äúworth‚Äù it to society to produce the extra unit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 1.3 reminds us that marginal costs rise as more of a product is produced.</p>
<p>Marginal benefits decline as society consumes more and more pizzas. In Figure 1.3 we can see that the optimal amount of pizza is 200,000 units, where marginal benefit just covers marginal cost.</p>
<p>Beyond 200,000 pizzas, the added benefits would be less than the added cost.</p>
<p>At less than 200,000, the added benefits will exceed the added costs, so it makes sense to produce more.</p>
<p><strong>Generalization:</strong> The optimal production of any item is where its marginal benefit is equal to its marginal cost. In our example, this must occur at 7,000 robots.</p>
<h3>Consider This ‚Ä¶ The Economics of War</h3>
<p>The costs of the war on terrorism at the end of 2015 were estimated to be around $1.4 trillion.</p>
<p>The war on terrorism can be represented by a movement along the production possibilities curve, as resources are reallocated from ‚Äúcivilian goods‚Äù to ‚Äúdefense goods.‚Äù The decision of how much to reallocate should be made by weighing the marginal benefits against the marginal costs of more defense goods.</p>
<p>Marginal benefit ‚Äì marginal cost analysis is needed to find the optimal mix of defense and civilian goods. The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks caused a perceived increase the MB curve for defense goods, and shifts in resources toward defense goods since the attacks reflect that perception. As the model reveals, however, it is possible to go too far, sacrificing too many civilian goods to obtain defense goods.</p>
<h2 id="module1-growth">Unemployment, Growth, and the Future</h2>
<p>Unemployment occurs when the economy is producing at less than full employment or inside the curve (point U in Figure 1.4).</p>
<p>A growing economy results in larger total output, and is illustrated by an outward shift of the production possibilities curve.</p>
<h3>There are three main causes of economic growth:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increases in the quantity of resources supplied.</li>
<li>Increases or improvements in the quality of resources supplied.</li>
<li>Advances in technology employed in the production or distribution process.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Present choices and future possibilities</h3>
<p>Using resources to produce consumer goods and services represents a choice for present over future consumption.</p>
<p>Using resources to invest in technological advance, education, and capital goods represents a choice for future over present goods.</p>
<p>The decision as to how to allocate resources in the present will create more or less economic growth in the future.</p>
<h2 id="module1-trade">A Qualification: International Trade</h2>
<p>A nation can avoid the output limits of its domestic production possibilities through international specialization and trade.</p>
<p>Specialization and trade have the same effect as having more and better resources or improved technology.</p>
<h2 id="module1-pitfalls">LAST WORD: Pitfalls to Sound Reasoning</h2>
<h3>Biases</h3>
<p>Preconceptions that are not based on facts.</p>
<h3>Loaded terminology</h3>
<p>Terms that contain the prejudice and value judgments of others.</p>
<p>It is very difficult for a person to describe economic behavior without letting their opinions about that behavior creep into their discussion. The distinction between positive and normative statements is not always clearly apparent.</p>
<p>Often, however, there is a deliberate attempt to sway opinion by using loaded terminology (greedy owners, obscene profits, exploited workers, mindless bureaucrats, costly regulations, creeping socialism).</p>
<h3>Fallacy of Composition</h3>
<p>Fallacy: What is true for one individual or part of a whole is necessarily true for a group of individuals or the whole.</p>
<p>Examples: An individual stockholder‚Äôs sales of shares v. a large number of stockholders selling large numbers of shares; revenues of an individual cattle rancher v. falling prices due to the actions of a large group of cattle ranchers.</p>
<h3>Causation Fallacies</h3>
<p><strong>Post hoc fallacy:</strong> When two events occur in time sequence, the first event is not necessarily the cause of the second event.</p>
<p><strong>Correlation versus causation:</strong> Events may be related without a causal relationship.</p>
<p>The positive relationship between education and income does not tell us which causes the increase in the other. (Which is the independent variable and which is the dependent variable?)</p>
<p>It may be that the increased income that occurs with increased education is due to some other third factor that is not under direct consideration.</p>

  Module 1 ‚Äì Lecture 2: The Market System and the Circular Flow
</h2>
<h3 id="module1-lecture2-lo">Learning Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Differentiate between laissez-faire capitalism, the command system, and the market system.</li>
<li>List the main characteristics of the market system.</li>
<li>Explain how the market system answers the five fundamental questions of what to produce, how to produce, who obtains the output, how to adjust to change, and how to promote progress.</li>
<li>Explain the operation of the ‚ÄúInvisible Hand‚Äù and why market economies usually do a better job than command economies at efficiently transforming economic resources into desirable output.</li>
<li>Describe the mechanics of the circular flow model.</li>
<li>Explain how the market system deals with risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="economic-systems">Economic Systems</h3>
<p>Economic systems differ in two important ways: Who owns the factors of production and the method used to coordinate economic activity.</p>
<h4>The Laissez-Faire system:</h4>
<ul>
<li>There is private ownership of resources.</li>
<li>Markets and prices coordinate and direct economic activity.</li>
<li>Each participant acts in his or her own self-interest.</li>
<li>In pure capitalism (Laissez-Faire capitalism) the government plays a very limited role.</li>
<li>In the U.S. version of capitalism, the government plays a substantial role. Thus, the U.S. economy is best categorized as a mixed economy.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Command economy, socialism or communism:</h4>
<ul>
<li>There is public (state) ownership of resources.</li>
<li>Economic activity is coordinated by central planning</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="market-characteristics">Characteristics of the Market System</h3>
<ul>
<li>Private individuals and firms own most of the private property (land and capital).</li>
<li>Private property, coupled with the freedom to negotiate binding legal contracts, enables individuals and businesses to obtain, control, use, and dispose of this property.</li>
<li>Private property rights spur mutually agreeable transactions.</li>
<li>Private property rights encourage investment, innovation, exchange of assets, maintenance of property, and economic growth.</li>
<li>Property rights extend to intellectual property through patents, copyrights, and trademarks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Freedom of enterprise and choice exist.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Freedom of enterprise means that entrepreneurs and businesses have the freedom to obtain and use resources, to produce products of their choice, and to sell these products in the markets of their choice.</li>
<li><strong>Freedom of choice</strong> means:
        <ul>
<li>Owners of property and money resources can use resources as they choose.</li>
<li>Workers can choose the training, occupations, and job of their choice.</li>
<li>Consumers are free to spend their income in such a way as to best satisfy their wants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Self-interest</h4>
<ul>
<li>Self interest is one of the driving forces in a market system. Entrepreneurs try to maximize profits or minimize losses; resource suppliers try to maximize income; consumers maximize satisfaction.</li>
<li>As each tries to maximize profits, income, satisfaction, the economy will benefit if competition is present.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Competition among buyers and sellers is a controlling mechanism.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Large numbers of sellers mean that no single producer or seller can control the price or market supply.</li>
<li>Large number of buyers means that no single consumer or employer can control the price or market demand.</li>
<li>Depending upon market conditions, producers can enter or leave industry easily.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="markets-prices">Markets and Prices</h3>
<ul>
<li>A market system conveys the decisions of the many buyers and sellers of the product and resource markets.</li>
<li>A market is an institution or mechanism that brings buyers and sellers into contact.</li>
<li>Individual decisions by buyers and sellers in the market determine the product and resource prices that, in turn, guide further decisions by resource owners, producers, and consumers.</li>
<li>Those who respond to the market signals will be rewarded with profits and income.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tech-capital">Reliance on Technology and Capital Goods</h3>
<ul>
<li>Competition, freedom of choice, self-interest, and the potential of profits provide the incentive for capital accumulation (investment).</li>
<li>Advanced technology and capital goods promote efficiency and greater output.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="specialization">Specialization</h3>
<ul>
<li>Division of labor allows workers to specialize.</li>
<li>People can take advantage of differences in abilities and skills.</li>
<li>People with identical skills may still benefit from specialization and improving certain skills. (Learning by doing)</li>
<li>Specialization saves time involved in shifting from one task to another.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Geographic specialization:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Regional and international specialization take advantage of localized resources.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="money">Use of Money as a Medium of Exchange</h3>
<ul>
<li>Money substitutes for barter, which requires a coincidence of wants. (I may want what you produce but you may not want to exchange for what I have.)</li>
<li>Willingness to accept money in place of goods permits 3-way trades (or multilateral trades). See Figure 2.1 and examples in text.</li>
<li>Floridians give money to Nebraskans for wheat, who give money to Idahoans for potatoes, who give money to Florida for oranges.</li>
<li>Foreign exchange markets permit Americans, Japanese, Germans, Britons, and Mexicans to complete international exchanges of goods and services.</li>
<li>Detroit autoworker produces crankshafts for Buicks. If the worker were paid in crankshafts, he would have to find grocers, clothing retailers, etc., who would be willing to exchange their products for a crankshaft. It is much more efficient to use money wages than to accept one‚Äôs wages in crankshafts!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limited-gov">Active, but Limited Government</h3>
<ul>
<li>Although the market system promotes efficiency, it has certain shortcomings (over production of goods with social costs, under production of goods with social benefits, tendency for business to increase monopoly power, macro instability).</li>
<li>Chapters 4 and 5 deals with how the government can increase the overall effectiveness of the market system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="five-questions">Five Fundamental Questions</h3>
<p>Although the focus of this chapter is on the market system, the five fundamental questions must be answered by all economic systems.</p>
<h4>What goods and services will to be produced?</h4>
<ul>
<li>In order to be profitable, businesses must respond to consumers‚Äô (individuals, other businesses, and the government) wants and desires.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Consumer Sovereignty</h4>
<p>Consumer sovereignty is the key to determining the types and quantities of the various products that will be produced. ‚ÄúDollar votes‚Äù for a product when purchases are made and ‚Äúdollar votes‚Äù against a product when products are ignored will determine which industries continue to exist and which individual products survive or fail.</p>
<h4>Consider This ‚Ä¶ McHits and McMisses</h4>
<p>In an effort to stimulate demand and respond to market trends and conditions, McDonald‚Äôs has introduced a number of new menu items over the years. The success and failure of these new items illustrates the important role of the consumer in determining what will be produced.</p>
<p>Businesses are not really ‚Äúfree‚Äù to produce what they wish. They must match their production choices with consumer choices or face losses and eventual bankruptcy. Profit-seeking firms must consider the allocation of the ‚Äúdollar votes‚Äù when they make their production decisions.</p>
<p>As with producers of consumer goods and services, decisions of resource suppliers are driven by the desires of consumers for the products produced by the resources they own.</p>
<h4>How will the goods and services be produced?</h4>
<p>The market system encourages and rewards those producers who are achieving least-cost production.</p>
<p>Least-cost production techniques include: locating firms in the optimum location considering resource prices, resource productivity, and transportation costs, available technology, and resource prices in general.</p>
<p>The most efficient technique will be the one that produces a given amount of output with the smallest input of scarce resources when both inputs and outputs are measured in dollars and cents.</p>
<h4>Who will get the output?</h4>
<p>The answer to this question is directly related to how the income is distributed among the individuals and the households and the tastes and preferences of consumers.</p>
<p>Products go to those who are willing and able to pay for them.</p>
<p>The productivity of the resources, the relative supply of particular resources, and the ownership of the resources will determine the income of individuals and households.</p>
<p>The resource markets, which determine income, are linked to this decision.</p>
<h4>How will the system accommodate change?</h4>
<p>Markets are dynamic ‚Äì what is efficient today may not be efficient tomorrow as tastes, technology, and resource supplies change. Prices help signal those changes.</p>
<p>An increase in demand for some products (fruit juice) will lead to higher prices in those markets; a decrease in demand for other products (milk) will lead to lower prices in those markets.</p>
<p>Increased demand leads to higher prices that induce greater quantities of output from suppliers. The opposite is true for a decrease in demand.</p>
<p>Higher prices lead to more profits and new firms entering the market; lower prices lead to losses and firms leaving the industry.</p>
<p>The guiding function of prices is essential to a well-functioning market system. In the absence of such signals, government or some similar institution would have to decide where resources are allocated, but without knowing what people in society want.</p>
<h4>How will the system promote progress?</h4>
<p>The market system promotes technological improvements and capital accumulation.</p>
<p>An entrepreneur or firm that introduces a popular new product will be rewarded with increased revenue and profits.</p>
<p>New technologies that reduce production costs, and thus product price, will spread throughout the industry as a result of competition.</p>
<p>Creative destruction occurs when new products and production methods destroy the market positions of firms that are not able or willing to adjust.</p>
<p>Technological advances often require additional capital. Entrepreneurs cast ‚Äúdollar votes‚Äù for capital, drawing resources to the production of capital goods.</p>
<h3 id="invisible-hand">Competition and the ‚ÄúInvisible Hand‚Äù</h3>
<ul>
<li>Competition is the mechanism of control for the market system. It not only guarantees that industry responds to consumer wants, but it also forces firms to adopt the most efficient production techniques.</li>
<li>Adam Smith talked of the ‚Äúinvisible hand‚Äù which promotes public interest through a market system where the primary motivation is self‚Äëinterest. By attempting to maximize profits, firms will also be producing the goods and services most wanted by society.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the many merits of the market system, three stand out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Market systems promote efficiency in the allocation of resources.</li>
<li>Market systems provide incentives for people to be productive through work effort and acquiring skills.</li>
<li>Market systems provide a lot of personal freedom in making economic decisions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="command-systems">The Demise of the Command Systems</h3>
<p>Command systems in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China eventually gave way to market systems. The failure of command systems can be attributed to two main problems:</p>
<h4>Coordination problem</h4>
<ul>
<li>It was difficult (if not impossible) for central planners to effectively coordinate the allocation of resources and satisfaction of wants of millions of consumers, resource suppliers, and businesses.</li>
<li>If an industry failed to meet production targets it could disrupt production and resource allocation throughout the system.</li>
<li>Larger planned economies faced even greater difficulties because the greater number and complexity of allocation decisions to be made.</li>
<li>Without market signals (i.e. prices) it was difficult to measure success. Even if quantitative production targets were met, ambiguities in the targets led to perverse outcomes in terms of poor quality, excessive costs, and the wrong mix of goods.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Incentive problem</h4>
<ul>
<li>With central planners determining what and how much would be produced, and how much resource suppliers would receive, there was little incentive to innovate, contain costs, or otherwise improve the quantity and quality of goods and services.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Consider This ‚Ä¶ The Two Koreas</h4>
<ul>
<li>North Korea, under the influence of the Soviet Union, established a command economy emphasizing government ownership and central government planning.</li>
<li>South Korea, protected by the U.S., established a market economy based on private ownership and profit motive.</li>
<li>South Korea has experienced significantly higher GDP, GDP per capita, exports, and imports than North Korea, which maintains an agrarian economy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="circular-flow">The Circular Flow Model for a Market-Oriented System (Key Graph 2.2)</h3>
<p>There are two groups of decision makers in the private economy (when government has not yet been included): households and businesses.</p>
<p>The market system coordinates these decisions.</p>
<h4>What happens in the resource markets?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Households sell resources directly or indirectly (through ownership of corporations).</li>
<li>Businesses buy resources in order to produce goods and services.</li>
<li>Flow of payments from businesses for the resources constitutes business costs and resource owners‚Äô incomes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What happens in the product markets?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Households are on the buying side of these markets, purchasing goods and services.</li>
<li>Businesses are on the selling side of these markets, offering products for sale.</li>
<li>Flow of consumer expenditures constitutes sales receipts for businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>The circular flow model illustrates this complex web of decision-making and economic activity that give rise to the real and money flows.</p>
<h4>Limitations of the model (not in text):</h4>
<ul>
<li>Does not depict transactions between households and between businesses.</li>
<li>Ignores government and the ‚Äúrest of the world‚Äù in the decision-making process.</li>
<li>Does not explain how prices of products and resources are actually determined, but this is explained in Chapter 3.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="risk">How the Market System Deals with Risk</h3>
<h4>The Profit System</h4>
<p>It falls to those acting as the firm‚Äôs entrepreneurs to deal with risk.</p>
<p>The entrepreneurs are guided by the so-called profit system. These individuals bear the risk; they win if there is a gain in profit and lose if there is a loss. Therefore, entrepreneurs must make prudent decisions to avoid unnecessary risks.</p>
<p>Command economies do not manage risk well because the central planners do not face the risk themselves.</p>
<h4>Shielding Employees and Suppliers from Business Risk</h4>
<ul>
<li>Under the market system, only a firm‚Äôs owners are subject to business risk and the possibility of losing money.</li>
<li>Because everyone else is legally entitled to get paid before the firm's owners, the firm's owners are referred to as residual claimants in business law.</li>
<li>The firm‚Äôs employees and suppliers are not subject to profit risk. However, employees may bear employment risk, which depends on the profitability of the firm.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Benefits of Restricting Business Risk to Owners</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attracting Inputs:</strong> By concentrating risk on the owners of a firm it allows the firm to attract employees and suppliers.</li>
<li><strong>Focusing attention:</strong> Profit maximizing behavior by the firm helps achieve prudent risk management.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Consider This‚Ä¶ Insurance</h4>
<p>Insurance promotes economic growth and investment by transferring risk from those who have a low tolerance for risk to those who have a high tolerance for risk.</p>
<p>Insurance also promotes growth and development by allowing individuals to pool the risk across a number of different individuals.</p>
<h3>LAST WORD: Shuffling the Deck</h3>
<p>If one thoroughly shuffles a deck of cards, there is a virtual 100% chance that the resulting arrangement of cards will be unlike any previous arrangement.</p>
<p>Yet, even though there are tens of billions of resources in the world, these resources are arranged in such a way as to produce the products and services that serve human needs.</p>
<p>Private property eliminates the possibility that resource arrangements will be random because each resource owner will choose a particular course of action if it promises rewards to the owner that exceed the rewards promised by all other available actions.</p>
<p>The result is a complex and productive arrangement of countless resources.</p>

  Module 2 ‚Äì Lecture 1: Demand, Supply, and Market Equilibrium
</h2>
<h3 id="module2-lecture1-lo">Learning Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Characterize and give examples of markets.</li>
<li>Describe demand and explain how it can change.</li>
<li>Describe supply and explain how it can change.</li>
<li>Relate how supply and demand interact to determine market equilibrium.</li>
<li>Explain how changes in supply and demand affect equilibrium prices and quantities.</li>
<li>Identify what government-set prices are and how they can cause product surpluses and shortages.</li>
<li>(Appendix) Illustrate how supply and demand analysis can provide insights on actual-economy situations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="markets">Markets</h3>
<p>A market, as introduced in Chapter 2, is an institution or mechanism that brings together buyers (demanders) and sellers (suppliers) of particular goods and services.</p>
<p>This chapter focuses on competitive markets with:</p>
<ul>
<li>a large number of independent buyers and sellers.</li>
<li>standardized goods.</li>
<li>prices that are ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù through the interaction of buyers and sellers. No individual can dictate the market price.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of the chapter is to explain the way in which markets adjust to changes and the role of prices in bringing the markets toward equilibrium.</p>
<h3 id="demand">Demand</h3>
<p>Demand is a schedule that shows the various amounts of a product that consumers are willing and able to buy at each specific price in a series of possible prices during a specified time period.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example of demand schedule for corn is Figure 3.1.</li>
<li>The schedule shows how much buyers are willing and able to purchase at five possible prices.</li>
<li>The market price depends on demand and supply.</li>
<li>To be meaningful, the demand schedule must have a period of time associated with it.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Law of Demand</h4>
<ul>
<li>Other things being equal, as price increases, the corresponding quantity demanded falls.</li>
<li>There is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded.</li>
<li>‚ÄúOther-things-equal‚Äù refers to consumer income and tastes, prices of related goods, and other factors besides the price of the product.</li>
<li>Explanation of the law of demand:</li>
<ul>
<li><strong>Diminishing marginal utility:</strong> Each additional unit gives less added satisfaction.</li>
<li><strong>Income effect:</strong> A lower price increases purchasing power, allowing more to be bought without reducing other consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Substitution effect:</strong> A lower price makes a good more attractive compared to alternatives.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4>The Demand Curve</h4>
<ul>
<li>Illustrates the inverse relationship between price and quantity (see corn example, Figure 3.1).</li>
<li>Downward slope reflects Law of Demand: higher quantity at lower prices and vice versa.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Individual vs. Market Demand</h4>
<ul>
<li>Market demand is the horizontal sum of individual demand schedules (see Figure 3.2).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Determinants of Demand</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tastes</strong> ‚Äì favorable changes increase demand; unfavorable changes decrease it.</li>
<li><strong>Number of buyers</strong> ‚Äì more buyers increase demand; fewer decrease it.</li>
<li><strong>Income</strong> ‚Äì rising income increases demand for normal goods, decreases it for inferior goods.</li>
<li><strong>Prices of related goods</strong>:
    <ul>
<li><strong>Substitute goods</strong>: price of one rises ‚Üí demand for the other rises.</li>
<li><strong>Complementary goods</strong>: price of one rises ‚Üí demand for the other falls.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Consumer expectations</strong> ‚Äì expected higher prices/incomes increase current demand.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Change in Demand vs. Quantity Demanded</h4>
<ul>
<li>A price change moves along a curve (quantity demanded).</li>
<li>A determinant change shifts the curve (demand).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="supply">Supply</h3>
<p>Supply is a schedule that shows amounts of a product a producer is willing and able to produce and sell at each specific price during a specified period.</p>
<ul>
<li>See example of supply schedule for corn in Figure 3.4.</li>
<li>Schedule shows what quantities will be offered at various prices or what price will induce various quantities to be offered.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Law of Supply</h4>
<ul>
<li>Higher price ‚Üí greater quantity supplied (direct relationship).</li>
<li>Explanation: higher prices mean more profit potential.</li>
<li>Beyond some level, increasing marginal costs appear.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Supply Curve</h4>
<ul>
<li>Graph is upward sloping, showing direct relationship (Figure 3.5).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Determinants of Supply</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resource prices</strong> ‚Äì higher costs reduce supply; lower costs increase it.</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong> ‚Äì improvements increase supply.</li>
<li><strong>Taxes and subsidies</strong> ‚Äì taxes reduce, subsidies increase supply.</li>
<li><strong>Prices of related goods</strong> ‚Äì higher prices of alternatives may shift production away.</li>
<li><strong>Producer expectations</strong> ‚Äì future prices affect current supply.</li>
<li><strong>Number of sellers</strong> ‚Äì more sellers increase total supply.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Change in Supply vs. Quantity Supplied</h4>
<ul>
<li>Price change ‚Üí movement along supply curve.</li>
<li>Determinant change ‚Üí shift of the supply curve.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="equilibrium">Market Equilibrium</h3>
<ul>
<li>Equilibrium is where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded (Figure 3.6).</li>
<li>Above equilibrium ‚Üí surplus. Below equilibrium ‚Üí shortage.</li>
<li>Market clearing price = equilibrium price.</li>
<li>Graphically, it‚Äôs where supply and demand curves intersect.</li>
<li>Rationing function of prices: price changes coordinate buying and selling.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Consider This ‚Ä¶ Uber and Dynamic Pricing</h4>
<ul>
<li>Uber matches riders and drivers via internet, bypassing regulated taxi systems.</li>
<li>Uses dynamic pricing to balance supply and demand in real time.</li>
<li>Surge pricing draws more drivers to high-demand areas, reduces wait times.</li>
<li>Contrast: taxi prices are fixed and cannot adapt to demand changes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Efficiency</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Productive efficiency</strong>: Producing at least cost.</li>
<li><strong>Allocative efficiency</strong>: Producing what is most valued by society.</li>
<li>Both occur at equilibrium price and quantity in competitive markets.</li>
<li>Productive efficiency is necessary but not sufficient for allocative efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changes">Changes in Supply and Demand, and Equilibrium</h3>
<h4>Changing Demand (Supply held constant)</h4>
<ul>
<li>‚Üë Demand ‚Üí ‚Üë price and ‚Üë quantity (Figure 3.7a).</li>
<li>‚Üì Demand ‚Üí ‚Üì price and ‚Üì quantity (Figure 3.7b).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Changing Supply (Demand held constant)</h4>
<ul>
<li>‚Üë Supply ‚Üí ‚Üì price and ‚Üë quantity (Figure 3.7c).</li>
<li>‚Üì Supply ‚Üí ‚Üë price and ‚Üì quantity (Figure 3.7d).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Simultaneous Shifts (Table 3.3)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Supply ‚Üë &amp; Demand ‚Üì ‚Üí Price ‚Üì, Quantity depends on shift size.</li>
<li>Supply ‚Üì &amp; Demand ‚Üë ‚Üí Price ‚Üë, Quantity depends on shift size.</li>
<li>Both ‚Üë ‚Üí Quantity ‚Üë, Price depends on which shifts more.</li>
<li>Both ‚Üì ‚Üí Quantity ‚Üì, Price depends on which shifts more.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Consider This ‚Ä¶ Salsa and Coffee Beans</h4>
<ul>
<li>Law of Demand/Supply can appear violated if ‚Äúother things‚Äù aren‚Äôt held equal.</li>
<li>Price and quantity can rise together if demand is increasing.</li>
<li>Must distinguish between change in price and shift in demand or supply.</li>
<li>Example: Income rising can lead to higher price and more bought ‚Äî not a demand law violation, just a shift in the curve.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="price-controls">Application: Government-Set Prices (Ceilings and Floors)</h3>
<h4>Price Ceilings</h4>
<ul>
<li>Maximum legal price, set below equilibrium (e.g., gas, rent control).</li>
<li>Creates shortage: demand &gt; supply (Figure 3.8).</li>
<li>Results in rationing methods (coupons, lines) and black markets.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Price Floors</h4>
<ul>
<li>Minimum legal price, set above equilibrium (e.g., wheat, minimum wage).</li>
<li>Creates surplus: supply &gt; demand (Figure 3.9).</li>
<li>Overallocates resources, raises prices for consumers.</li>
<li>Minimum wage can be non-binding if below market rate in some regions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="student-loans">LAST WORD: Student Loans and Tuition Costs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Since 1958, the U.S. government has offered subsidized and guaranteed student loans to make college more affordable.</li>
<li>At first glance, student loans appear to help students afford rising tuition costs.</li>
<li>But evidence suggests the opposite ‚Äî that increased access to loans drives up tuition costs.</li>
<li>Data shows for every $1 in student loans, tuition rises by $0.70.</li>
<li>This implies loans may be inflating demand, raising prices rather than simply helping students keep up.</li>
</ul>
<h4>An Alternative Approach</h4>
<ul>
<li>Instead of subsidizing demand (loans), the government could subsidize supply (colleges).</li>
<li>More supply would shift the supply curve right, lowering prices for the same level of demand.</li>
<li>This strategy was used after WWII, when heavily subsidized state universities expanded rapidly.</li>

  Module 3 ‚Äì Lecture: GDP, GNP, NDP, NNP, NI, PI, DPI Explained
</h2>
<h3>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</h3>
<p>GDP is the monetary value of all finished goods and services produced within a country‚Äôs borders in a specific time period.</p>
<p>Three calculation methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Production Approach:</strong> Output value ‚àí intermediate goods</li>
<li><strong>Income Approach:</strong> Wages + profits + taxes ‚àí subsidies</li>
<li><strong>Expenditure Approach:</strong> C + I + G + (X ‚àí M)</li>
</ul>
<p>Measured in nominal or real terms (inflation-adjusted).</p>
<h3>Gross National Product (GNP)</h3>
<p>Total output by a country‚Äôs residents, regardless of location.</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> GNP = GDP + Net Factor Income from Abroad (NFIA)</p>
<h3>Net Domestic Product (NDP)</h3>
<p>GDP adjusted for depreciation.</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> NDP = GDP ‚àí Depreciation</p>
<h3>Net National Product (NNP)</h3>
<p>GNP adjusted for depreciation.</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> NNP = GNP ‚àí Depreciation</p>
<h3>Net National Income (NNI)</h3>
<p>Measures income after depreciation and adjusting for taxes/subsidies.</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> NNI = NNP ‚àí Indirect Taxes + Subsidies</p>
<h3>Personal Income (PI)</h3>
<p>Total income received by individuals from all sources before personal taxes.</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> PI = NI ‚àí Indirect Taxes ‚àí Corporate Taxes ‚àí Undistributed Corporate Profits + Transfer Payments</p>

</ol>
<!-- Additional sections omitted here for brevity. Full text added next step. -->
<h3 id="module3-cycle">II. Overview of the Business Cycle</h3>
<ul>
<li>Historical record:
    <ul>
<li>The United States‚Äô impressive long-run economic growth has been interrupted by periods of instability.</li>
<li>Uneven growth has been the pattern, with inflation often accompanying rapid growth, and declines in employment and output during periods of recession and depression (see Figure 9.1 and Table 9.1).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Four phases of the business cycle are identified:
    <ul>
<li>Peak: temporary maximum with full employment and near-capacity output.</li>
<li>Recession: decline in total output, income, employment, and trade lasting six months or more.</li>
<li>Trough: the bottom of the recession period.</li>
<li>Recovery: output and employment are expanding toward full-employment level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Possible causes include major innovations, changes in productivity, monetary factors, political events, and financial instability.</li>
<li>Aggregate spending is an important factor, especially changes on capital goods and consumer durables.</li>
<li>Cyclical fluctuations: Durable goods output is more volatile than nondurables and services.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="module3-unemployment">III. Unemployment (one result of economic downturns)</h3>
<h4>A. Measuring Unemployment</h4>
<ul>
<li>Population divided into three groups:
    <ul>
<li>Under age sixteen or institutionalized</li>
<li>‚ÄúNot in labor force‚Äù</li>
<li>Labor force: age sixteen and over, willing and able to work, and actively seeking work</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unemployment rate = % of the labor force not employed</li>
<li>Based on survey of 60,000 households nationwide</li>
<li>Understates actual unemployment due to:
    <ul>
<li>Part-time workers counted as employed</li>
<li>Discouraged workers not counted as unemployed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>B. Types of Unemployment</h4>
<ul>
<li>Frictional: job seekers or waiting to start soon</li>
<li>Structural: due to changes in demand for labor</li>
<li>Cyclical: due to recession phase of the cycle</li>
<li>Full employment ‚â† zero unemployment</li>
<li>Full-employment unemployment rate = frictional + structural</li>
<li>Also called the natural rate of unemployment</li>
<li>Not fixed; influenced by demographics, policies</li>
</ul>
<h4>C. Economic Cost of Unemployment</h4>
<ul>
<li>GDP Gap = Potential GDP ‚àí Actual GDP (Okun‚Äôs Law: each 1% above natural rate ‚áí ~2% GDP gap)</li>
<li>Unequal burdens: higher rates for teens, African-Americans, less-educated; white-collar workers lower</li>
<li>Long-term unemployment increased during Great Recession</li>
</ul>
<h4>D. Noneconomic Costs</h4>
<ul>
<li>Loss of self-respect</li>
<li>Social and political unrest</li>
</ul>
<h4>E. International Comparisons</h4>
<p>(see Global Perspective 9.1)</p>
<h4>F. Consider This . . . Downwardly Sticky Wages and Unemployment</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wages are flexible upward but sticky downward</li>
<li>Managers prefer layoffs over nominal pay cuts ‚áí unemployment rises in recessions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="module3-inflation">IV. Inflation: Defined and Measured</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> A rising general level of prices (not all prices rise equally).</li>
<li><strong>Consumer Price Index (CPI)</strong> is the main index used.
    <ul>
<li>Formula: (This year‚Äôs index ‚àí Last year‚Äôs index) / Last year‚Äôs index √ó 100</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rule of 70:</strong> 70 √∑ inflation rate = years for price level to double.</li>
</ul>
<h4>D. Facts of Inflation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Deflation can also be a problem.</li>
<li>All industrial nations have experienced inflation.</li>
<li>Hyperinflation examples: Zimbabwe 2008, 14.9 billion percent.</li>
</ul>
<h4>E. Causes and Theories of Inflation</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Demand-pull:</strong> ‚ÄúToo much spending chasing too few goods.‚Äù</li>
<li><strong>Consider This: Clipping Coins</strong>
<ul>
<li>Clipping coins to mint new money caused inflation, acted as tax.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cost-push:</strong> Rise in per-unit production costs
    <ul>
<li>Output/employment fall while prices rise (supply shocks)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Complexities:</strong> Demand vs cost sources can be hard to distinguish.</li>
</ul>
<h4>F. Core Inflation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Excludes food and energy prices (which are volatile).</li>
<li>If CPI rises but core stays low ‚Üí no policy change may be needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="module3-redistribution">V. Redistributive Effects of Inflation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Inflation redistributes real income, not necessarily reducing national real income.</li>
<li><strong>Unanticipated inflation</strong> is more damaging:
    <ul>
<li>Hurts fixed-income groups (real income falls)</li>
<li>Hurts savers (interest may not match inflation)</li>
<li>Helps debtors, hurts lenders (real value of payments falls)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Anticipated inflation</strong> can be prepared for (contracts, rates adjusted).</li>
<li><strong>Inflation premium:</strong> extra interest charged to account for expected inflation</li>
<li><strong>Real interest rate:</strong> Nominal rate ‚àí Inflation premium</li>
</ul>
<h4>G. Final Points</h4>
<ul>
<li>Unexpected deflation has the opposite effect of inflation.</li>
<li>Most families are both helped and hurt in different ways.</li>
</ul>
<h4>H. Negative Nominal Interest Rates</h4>
<ul>
<li>Used post-Great Recession to stimulate economies.</li>
<li>Goal: Penalize saving, encourage spending/investment.</li>
</ul>
<h4>I. Consider This: The Specter of Deflation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Deflation can lead to bankruptcies and layoffs ‚Üí spiral.</li>
<li>Central banks aim to avoid this via policy ‚Üí maintain positive inflation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="module3-output">VI. Output Effects of Inflation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost-push inflation:</strong> Unexpected rise in resource prices ‚Üí output/employment fall, real income drops.</li>
<li><strong>Mild inflation (under 3%)</strong> has mixed effects:
    <ul>
<li>Can be a by-product of prosperity, or</li>
<li>Can reduce real income and harm stability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Creeping inflation ‚Üí hyperinflation:</strong> Reckless spending, speculation, examples: post-WWII Japan, post-WWI Germany</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="module3-lastword">VII. LAST WORD: Employment After the Great Recession</h3>
<ul>
<li>Post-recession recovery was slow: ~4.5 years to return to pre-recession employment.</li>
<li>Even then, job numbers were misleading:
    <ul>
<li>Shift from full-time to part-time work</li>
<li>Age-related shifts in employment patterns</li>
<li>Employment-population ratio stayed below pre-recession level</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="module-3-lecture-2">Module 3 ‚Äì Lecture 2: Basic Macroeconomic Relationships</h2><h3 id="module-3-lecture-2-introduction">I. Introduction‚ÄîWhat Are the Basic Macro Relationships?</h3>
<p><strong>I. Introduction‚ÄîWhat Are the Basic Macro Relationships?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Learning Objectives ‚Äì After reading this chapter, students should be able to:
    <ol>
<li>Describe how changes in income affect consumption and saving.</li>
<li>List and explain factors other than income that can affect consumption.</li>
<li>Explain how changes in real interest rates affect investment.</li>
<li>Identify and explain factors other than the real interest rate that can affect investment.</li>
<li>Illustrate how changes in investment (or one of the other components of total spending) can increase or decrease real GDP by a multiple amount.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>This chapter focuses on three macroeconomic relationships:
    <ol>
<li>Income and consumption, and income and saving</li>
<li>The interest rate and investment</li>
<li>Changes in spending and changes in output</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="module-3-lecture-2-income-consumption-saving">II. The Income-Consumption and Income-Saving Relationships</h3>
<p><strong>II. The Income-Consumption and Income-Saving Relationships</strong></p>
<p>Disposable income is the most important determinant of consumer spending. What is not spent is saved.</p>
<p>Key points include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumption schedules and saving schedules (e.g., dissaving at low income levels)</li>
<li>APC = C / Income; APS = S / Income</li>
<li>MPC = ŒîC / ŒîIncome; MPS = ŒîS / ŒîIncome</li>
<li>MPC + MPS = 1</li>
<li>Nonincome determinants: wealth, expectations, interest rates, household borrowing</li>
<li>Taxation and stability of schedules</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="module-3-lecture-2-interest-investment">III. The Interest Rate‚ÄîInvestment Relationship</h3>
<p><strong>III. The Interest Rate‚ÄîInvestment Relationship</strong></p>
<p>Investment is guided by expected return versus real interest rate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real interest rate is the cost of borrowing or opportunity cost of using own funds</li>
<li>Investment demand curve: inverse relationship with real interest rate</li>
<li>Determinants of expected returns: costs, taxes, technology, capital on hand, expectations</li>
<li>Investment is volatile due to shifting expectations and durability of capital goods</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="module-3-lecture-2-multiplier-effect">IV. The Multiplier Effect</h3>
<p><strong>IV. The Multiplier Effect</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiplier = 1 / MPS or 1 / (1 - MPC)</li>
<li>Change in GDP = Change in spending √ó Multiplier</li>
<li>The multiplier works in both directions and is affected by all leakages: savings, taxes, imports</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 0;">üßÆ Formula Sheet: Module 3 ‚Äì Lecture 2</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>APC (Average Propensity to Consume):</strong> APC = Consumption / Income</li>
<li><strong>APS (Average Propensity to Save):</strong> APS = Saving / Income</li>
<li><strong>MPC (Marginal Propensity to Consume):</strong> MPC = ŒîConsumption / ŒîIncome</li>
<li><strong>MPS (Marginal Propensity to Save):</strong> MPS = ŒîSaving / ŒîIncome</li>
<li><strong>Multiplier:</strong> 1 / MPS or 1 / (1 - MPC)</li>
<li><strong>Change in GDP:</strong> ŒîGDP = Initial Change in Spending √ó Multiplier</li>

<h2 id="module4">üìí Module 4: Fiscal Policy, Deficits, and Debt</h2>

<h3 id="fiscal-policy">Fiscal Policy and the AD-AS Model</h3>
<ul>
<li>Discretionary fiscal policy refers to the deliberate manipulation of taxes and government spending by Congress to alter real domestic output and employment, control inflation, and stimulate economic growth.</li>
<li>Discretionary changes are initiated by the president on the advice of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA).</li>
<li>Nondiscretionary (passive) policy changes happen automatically with the economy‚Äôs fluctuations.</li>
<li>Expansionary policy combats recession (increasing G, decreasing T, or both), shifting AD right.</li>
<li>Contractionary policy combats inflation by reducing G, increasing T, or both, shifting AD left.</li>
<li>Economists debate whether G or T is the better tool, depending on political and social priorities.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="built-in-stability">Built-In Stability</h3>
<ul>
<li>Taxes rise with GDP; transfers rise when GDP falls.</li>
<li>More progressive tax systems create more built-in stability.</li>
<li>Stability helps reduce fluctuations but doesn‚Äôt eliminate them.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="evaluating-policy">Evaluating Fiscal Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>The cyclically adjusted budget compares government revenue/spending at full employment.</li>
<li>Actual budget deficits may reflect automatic stabilizers, not discretionary action.</li>
<li>Structural deficits indicate deliberate expansionary policy.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="policy-criticisms">Problems and Criticisms of Fiscal Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Timing lags (recognition, administrative, operational) weaken policy effectiveness.</li>
<li>Political pressures and reversals may hinder sound policy.</li>
<li>State/local budget rules may counter federal stimulus efforts.</li>
<li>‚ÄúCrowding out‚Äù from government borrowing could raise interest rates and reduce private investment.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="public-debt">Public Debt</h3>
<ul>
<li>Public debt is the accumulated total of past deficits and surpluses.</li>
<li>Most U.S. debt is held by the public and government agencies; foreign ownership is significant.</li>
<li>Debt interest payments are a fiscal burden and affect income distribution.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="false-debt-concerns">False Concerns About the Debt</h3>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. can refinance debt and tax to repay obligations.</li>
<li>The burden is more nuanced‚Äîdebt is also an asset to those who hold it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="money-and-banking">Money, Banking, and Financial Institutions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Functions of money: medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value.</li>
<li>Definitions:
  <ul>
    <li>M1: Currency + checkable deposits</li>
    <li>M2: M1 + savings deposits, small time deposits, money market funds</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Credit cards are not money; they are short-term loans.</li>
<li>Money‚Äôs value is backed by government‚Äôs credibility and scarcity.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="federal-reserve">The Federal Reserve System</h3>
<ul>
<li>Established in 1913; includes Board of Governors, Federal Open Market Committee, 12 regional banks.</li>
<li>Main functions: issuing currency, regulating reserves, lending to banks, setting policy.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="financial-crisis">The 2007‚Äì2008 Financial Crisis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Subprime mortgage defaults triggered collapse of mortgage-backed securities.</li>
<li>Securitization spread risk globally, worsening instability.</li>
<li>Major institutions like AIG, Citibank, and others received emergency aid via TARP ($700B bailout).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="postcrisis-reform">Postcrisis Regulation and Reform</h3>
<ul>
<li>Government aimed to regulate risk and reduce ‚Äúmoral hazard.‚Äù</li>
<li>Greater consolidation among banks; tighter regulations on lending and securitization.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="extend-and-pretend">Extend and Pretend</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Fed provided emergency liquidity to both solvent and insolvent firms to prevent collapse.</li>
<li>This increased moral hazard but likely averted a deeper crisis.</li>
</ul>
